TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.  \n \nThe cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range, known as the acknowledgement range, of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size, which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput, but the larger the TCP window size, the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution, making this type of attack impractical. However, some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number, making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations.\n \nThis is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option, as described in RFC 1323, to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion.\n \nThis vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session, causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port.\n \nThere are a few factors that may present viable target implementations, such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections, those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack, due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result, this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms.\n \nAnother factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions, as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order, dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others.\n \nIt should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products, investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further.","impact":"Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.","solution":"Please first check the results section below for the port number on which this vulnerability was detected.

A short description of these techniques is provided below. The specific technique used to identify the OS on this host is included in the RESULTS section of your report.\n \n1)  TCP\/IP Fingerprint : The operating system of a host can be identified from a remote system using TCP\/IP fingerprinting. All underlying operating system TCP\/IP stacks have subtle differences that can be seen in their responses to specially-crafted TCP packets. According to the results of this \"fingerprinting\" technique, the OS version is among those listed below. \n \nNote that if one or more of these subtle differences are modified by a firewall or a packet filtering device between the scanner and the host, the fingerprinting technique may fail. Consequently, the version of the OS may not be detected correctly. If the host is behind a proxy-type firewall, the version of the operating system detected may be that of the firewall instead of the host being scanned.\n \n2)  NetBIOS : Short for Network Basic Input Output System, an application programming interface (API) that augments the DOS BIOS by adding special functions for local-area networks (LANs). Almost all LANs for PCs are based on the NetBIOS. Some LAN manufacturers have even extended it, adding additional network capabilities. NetBIOS relies on a message format called Server Message Block (SMB). \n \n3)  PHP Info : PHP is a hypertext pre-processor, an open-source, server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. Under some configurations it is possible to call PHP functions like phpinfo() and obtain operating system information.\n \n4)  SNMP : The Simple Network Monitoring Protocol is used to monitor hosts, routers, and the networks to which they attach. The SNMP service maintains Management Information Base (MIB), a set of variables (database) that can be fetched by Managers. These include \"MIB_II.system.sysDescr\" for the operating system.","impact":"Not  applicable.","solution":"Not  applicable.","exploitability":null,"associated_malware":null,"results":"Operating System\tTechnique\tID\nLinux 2.2-2.6\tTCP\/IP Fingerprint\tM1141:5927::21","pci_vuln":"no","instance":null,"category":"Information gathering"},

Clickjacking, also known as a \"UI redress attack\", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page.  \nX-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSS-Protection: 0; disables this functionality. \nX-Content-Type-Options: This HTTP header prevents attacks based on MIME-type mismatch. The only possible value is nosniff. If your server returns X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff in the response, the browser will refuse to load the styles and scripts in case they have an incorrect MIME-type.  \nStrict-Transport-Security: The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. \nQID Detection Logic: \nThis unauthenticated QID looks for the presence of the following HTTP responses: \nValid directives for X-Frame-Options are: \nX-Frame-Options: DENY - The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. \nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. \nX-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM RESOURCE-URL - The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin. \nValid directives for X-XSS-Protections are: \nX-XSS-Protection: 1 - Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts). \nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected. \nX-XSS-Protection: 1; report=URI  - Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report. \nX-XSS-Protection: 0 disables this directive and hence is also treated as not detected. \nA valid directive for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff \nA valid HSTS directive Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; [; includeSubDomains][; preload] \n NOTE:  All report-only directives (where applicable) are considered invalid.","impact":"Depending on the vulnerability being exploited, an unauthenticated remote attacker could conduct cross-site scripting, clickjacking or MIME-type sniffing attacks.","solution":"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure mentions the following - The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product. A \"missing\" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An \"insufficient\" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an \"ignored\" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path. \nCustomers are advised to set proper X-Frame-Options (https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Headers\/X-Frame-Options), X-XSS-Protection (https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Headers\/X-XSS-Protection), X-Content-Type-Options (https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Headers\/X-Content-Type-Options) and Strict-Transport-Security (https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Headers\/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP response headers. \nDepending on their server software, customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files. Few examples are: \nX-Frame-Options: \nApache: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN \nnginx: add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN; \nHAProxy: rspadd X-Frame-Options:\\ SAMEORIGIN \nIIS: <HTTPPROTOCOL><CUSTOMHEADERS><ADD NAME=\"X-Frame-Options\" VALUE=\"SAMEORIGIN\"><\/ADD><\/CUSTOMHEADERS><\/HTTPPROTOCOL> \nX-XSS-Protection: \nApache: Header always set X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"  \nPHP: header(\"X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\"); \nX-Content-Type-Options: \nApache: Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff \nHTTP Strict-Transport-Security: \nApache: Header always set Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\" \nNginx: add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000; \n  Note: Network devices that include a HTTP\/HTTPS console for administrative\/management purposes often do not include all\/some of the security headers.
